<H1>Icarus</H1>

This is a lovingly ported version of Zack Schollz's Monome Norns patch called Icarus (original found here: <https://github.com/schollz/icarus>) for the Organelle M/S.

Original leveraged Lua for UI- because Organelle has it's own specific way of doing UI I have used only supercollider here for both sounds and visuals
